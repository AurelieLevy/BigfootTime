This projet was made as part of a laboratory for the course named TWEB (HEIG-VD).
It's about the Bigfoot. We've used some datas to create charts with D3. The goal was firstly to learn to use it. In any case the informations we give are not to take seriously! The datas we used are findable on the web (see the part name Data in this file)
Our goal was to make something funny, and we used some informations that are not verified.

## Data
All the data used about the bigfoot where found here:
* https://data.world/timothyrenner/bfro-sightings-data
* //TODO

A major part of those datas where recolted by "The Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization" founded in 1995. They allow you to report your sighting and ask you to describe it to keep their data updated.

## treatements of the data
